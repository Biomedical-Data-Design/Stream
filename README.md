# Stream

Zhenyu Xiao, Haobin Zhou, Yimeng Xu, and Emma Cardenas.

We are a group of students from Johns Hopkins University. Our project is focusing on **Track patient recovery in real-time by processing streaming data** in the course Biomedical Data Design.

This repository will contain our source codes and progress every week.

The database we are using is **eICU Database**, you can access the database on their website after completing the course on data security and ethics: https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/2.0/
